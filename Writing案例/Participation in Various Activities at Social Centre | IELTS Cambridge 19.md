Analysis
This is a good report. All major changes and all participant groups are covered. Grammar is good. A variety of sentence patterns are used with hardly any grammar mistakes. For example, there are both complex and compound sentences. The opening sentence is a complex sentence containing a relative clause. The writer is able to connect clauses with conjunctions and relative clauses and demonstrates a higher level of accuracy with grammatical structures. The information is presented logically and a number of cohesive elements (overall, afterwards) are used. Vocabulary is generally good. The writer makes good use of words and phrases that indicate change (decreased marginally, fluctuated slightly, decreased sharply, shot up). Overall, this seems band 9.![img.png](images/2.png)
