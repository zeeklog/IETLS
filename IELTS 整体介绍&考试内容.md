IELTS has two formats. Academic IELTS is for students who want to pursue undergraduate or postgraduate studies in an English speaking country. Candidates seeking professional registration may also have to take this test.

General Training IELTS is for candidates who would like to migrate to the UK, Australia, New Zealand or Canada. Those interested in studying below the degree level may also have to take this test.

Both modules have four components and they are taken in the following order.

Listening module
It consists of 4 parts with 10 questions each. You have 30 minutes to answer 40 questions.

The first part is usually a conversation between two people and the second part is a monologue. The third part is a conversation between 3 or 4 people and the fourth part is a monologue. While the first 2 recordings are concerned with social situations, the last two have training or academic contexts.

You have to answer the questions as you hear the recording. Note that the recording is played only once. You will get 10 minutes at the end to transfer your answers to the answer sheet. In the Listening module, you will hear a variety of voices and accents. Sometimes, you may even hear non-native English accents such as Spanish or German. While no specialist knowledge is required to answer the questions in the Listening module, you should be able to understand a variety of social and academic topics. Each question in the Listening module carries one mark.

The Listening and Speaking tests are the same for both Academic and General Training candidates.

Reading module
The reading test consists of 3 sections with 40 questions. You have to read three passages taken from various sources like magazines, newspapers, books and journals. It takes about 60 minutes.
